# ANN-MIC
MIC implementation of an ANN (artificial neural network)
The ANN algorithm is learning model inspired by biological neurons of human brain. The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is an ANN 
in which each node has avalue that propagates to the nodes of the next layer. Every node of one layer is fully connected to 
all nodes of the adjacent layer. 
The MLP is determined by the number of nodes and the number of layers an the weights between each layer nodes. 
The input values propagate to the next layer resulted by the weighted sum of the input nodes and an activation function (sigmoid). 
This calulation approximates the unknown function with only a statistical learning model.
